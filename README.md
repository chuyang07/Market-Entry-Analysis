## Project Overview
- **Issue**
- 1. Entering Northern Virginia (VA) reuiqres navigating state-specific alcohol regulations and cross-state approvals
  2. VA's mature local beer ecosystem raises competitive and operational barriers
- **Goal**
- Assess feasibility and map the path for this Maryland (MD) brewery to expand distribution into northern VA

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Background & Problem Statement
- **Manor Hill Brewing**
- It's MD's largest farm brewery, founded by Randy and Mary Marriner and based on a 54-acre farm in Ellicott City. Today, the Marriner's enterprise includes the brewery itself and several restaurants. Their brand story and values lie in quality beer, family, community and innovation.
- The brewery has established distribution channels across MD, D.C., and Delaware. Based on the success, Manor Hill is now considering expansion into northern VA
- For more details, see [Manor Hill Brand Overview]
- **Challenges**
- 1. Legal complexity due to state-specific alcohol regulation
  2. Market and consumer fit due to unique beer ecosystem
- **Problem statement**
- Manor Hill Brewing is eyeing on whether and how to expand into northern VA 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Methodology
- **Regulatory Research**
- Confirmed VA's regulations on alcohol beverages are stricter than MD's
- Defined 2 viable entry pathways
- 1. Self-distribution into VA
     Apply for Non-residence Brewery License + label and franchise approval from the Virginia ABC
     Establish retail partnerships
     Obtain TTB permission to sell alcoholic beverages in VA
  2. Partner with a VA distributor
     VA distributor moves product to retailers
     Similar to Process above but no Non-residence Brewery License required
- **Market Outreach**
- Contacted VA distributors with MD brewer experience and VA retailers currently selling MD beers (groceries, restaurants, tap rooms)
- Compiled potential partners and analyze pros and cons
- **Challenge Analysis**
- Assessed likely competitors and out-of-state brand challenges
- Proposed practical ideas as solutions for their consideration

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Key Takeaways & Impact
- **Findings and Recommendations**
- 1. F: VA's franchise law for alcoholic beverages makes distributor contracts strictor and harder to terminate compared to MD
     R: Prioritize 6 potential distributors we provided, while considering limited self-distribution in northern VA to maintain control over product
- 2. F: Chain supermarkets are highly competitive and dominated by national and local brands; Restaurants are more receptive to unique craft beers
     R: Focus on smaller retailers, gas stations, and select on-premises restaurants aligned with Manor Hill's brand identity
- 3. F: Virginia consumers strongly favor â€œdrink local
     R: Emphasize Manor Hill's family and sustainability value, reinforced through tap takeovers, tasting events, and partnerships with local organizations
- 4. F: Competitors like Union Craft already dominate with IPAs and lagers
     R: Position Manor Hill with differentiated offerings such as seasonal specialties to stand apart
- **Impact**
- This project provided Manor Hill Brewing with a clear roadmap for market entry, including regulatory steps, distributor prioritization, retail targeting, and community engagement strategies
- The findings were delivered to the clients and advisors with future steps
